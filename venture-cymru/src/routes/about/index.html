        <p>Over the many years we&apos;ve been in service, we have made a great cultural impact in the UK, even dating
            back as far as the original Llandudno Promenade Theatre in 1894 (that's <span

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Venue Cymru is has a very rich history over several decades, and we've managed to become a hub or sorts for
            entertainment in Wales.</p>
        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <p>Our roots can be traced all the way back to the Llandudno Promenade Theatre, originally built in 1894. The
            theatre underwent several transformations over many years and hosted many performances for people to enjoy.
        </p>
        <h3>Modernisation</h3>
        <p>
            The 20th century is when the theatre was greatly modernised. With growing demands of a diverse range of
            events, we had to revolutionise the theatre. After the revamp, we re-opened under the name
            Venue Cymru in 2007, as we had far expanded beyond our original goal of just traditional theatre
            performances.
