# JavaScript Header Colour Change

This exercise had us using JavaScript to change the colour of a HTML element.

To run this, simply open the `index.html` file.

> **NOTE**
> This effect may not be visible if the JavaScript is executed too fast.
> The effect is applied the second the webpage is loaded, the header should
> change from a gray colour to a random HEX value for the background and
> foreground. You may reload the page a few times to see this in action!
